## Sudoku game

This is a simple Sudoku game that allows users to play Sudoku on a 9x9 grid. The game is implemented in Java and uses the Swing library for the GUI.

## How to run the game

To run the game, you can use an IDE like Eclipse or NetBeans, or you can compile and run the code from the command line.

## How to play the game

The goal of the game is to fill in the empty cells of the grid with numbers from 1 to 9, in such a way that each row, column, and 3x3 box contains all the numbers from 1 to 9 without repeating.

To enter a number in a cell, click on the cell and type the number on your keyboard. If the number you entered is correct, the cell will turn green. If it's incorrect, the cell will turn red. You can also use the "Aide" button to fill in some of the empty cells, or the "Résoudre" button to fill in all the cells with the correct numbers.

 ## Limitations

Note that this game does not include a solver that can generate or solve Sudoku puzzles automatically. Therefore, the game can only be played with a pre-defined puzzle that is hard-coded in the code.
